# miniROS
Project updated on 2 May 2017
It's been a year since from last post of miniROS project.
The mini OS is now achieved and named as Arbutus OS.
The OS is now with arm and x86 version, 
Since the arm version(32, 64 bit OS) is mainly tested on 
raspberry pi 3b model, and the x86 version of the OS is tested
on two very old pcs(586s models) and the boost speed is rather 
acceptable.
After the basic foudation of OS is sufficient, ive added ROS features
to the OS, to enable the OS to be used to ranged purposes.

Now, all the foundation works are done. the afterwards are some frame works
to make the OS easy to install plus more stuff to suits a functional laptop OS.
