# miniROS
The purpose of the this project is to try to write a minimum OS for ROS
Previously, the ROS would be perfectly working on Linux Ubuntu OS
However, all of the features are based on the Linux Cores,
But rest of the features are not used and been wasted.
Thus, I tried to cope with the a minimum working OS for the ROS
To do so, I've break down the projects into several steps:
Hopefully I could make this happen. So, finger crosses then.
TO-DO lists:
-read books about basic OS 
-Linux 0.11
-write code line by line
-read structure of ROS

I'll keep my satus updated.
best of luck.
